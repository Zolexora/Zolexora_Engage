# FleetRelay

## Code layout

The repository is organized by deployable application and feature ownership:

```text
artifacts/
  api-server/
    src/App.ts              # Express middleware and API assembly
    src/routes/             # HTTP route modules
  client/
    src/app/App.tsx         # React providers and routing
    src/features/auth/      # Supabase auth gate and login UI
    src/features/dispatch/  # Duty-sheet import, queue, and WhatsApp dispatch
    src/components/ui/      # Shared UI primitives for the frontend
lib/
  api-spec/                 # OpenAPI source
  api-zod/                  # Generated request/response schemas
  api-client-react/         # Generated frontend API client
  db/                       # Database schema and Drizzle setup
```

## Deployment

The recommended free deployment separates the public frontend from the API:

- **Frontend:** Cloudflare Pages, built from `artifacts/client`
- **API:** Render Web Service, configured by `render.yaml`
- **Database and authentication:** Supabase
- **WhatsApp webhook:** the public Render API URL at
  `/api/whatsapp/webhook`

### Render API

Create a Render Blueprint from this repository. The Blueprint creates
`fleetrelay-api` from `docker/api.Dockerfile` and uses `/api/healthz` for
health checks. Add the values marked `sync: false` in the Render dashboard;
never commit them to the repository.

### Cloudflare Pages frontend

Use these build settings:

```text
Root directory: /
Build command: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm --filter @workspace/client build
Build output directory: artifacts/client/dist
```

Set these Pages environment variables for the production environment:

```text
VITE_API_URL=https://<your-render-api>.onrender.com
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project>.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your-supabase-publishable-key>
```

After deployment, set the Supabase Auth site URL and redirect URL to the
Cloudflare Pages HTTPS URL. Configure the Meta WhatsApp webhook as:

```text
https://<your-render-api>.onrender.com/api/whatsapp/webhook
```

## Run with Docker

The project runs as two containers:

- API: <http://localhost:3000>
- Web App: <http://localhost:5174>

Docker names: `fleetrelay-api` and `fleetrelay-web`.

The encrypted `.env` key is loaded from Bitwarden at runtime. No `.env.keys`
file is required.

```bash
export BW_SESSION="$(bw unlock --raw)"
./scripts/RunProject.sh
```

Stop the stack with `Ctrl+C`. To remove the containers and network:

```bash
docker compose down
```

For local Vite development with Supabase variables loaded from Bitwarden:

```bash
export BW_SESSION="$(bw unlock --raw)"
./scripts/RunWebDev.sh
```

## Duty sheet format

Import an `.xlsx`, `.xls`, or `.csv` file with one row per driver. The sheet
must include these columns:

- `Vehicle Number`
- `Driver Name`
- `Mobile Number`
- `Pending Duty Count`

Column names are matched case-insensitively and spaces/punctuation are ignored.
Rows missing any required value are rejected so only complete rows can be sent
through WhatsApp.

WhatsApp server credentials are loaded only by the API from the encrypted
`.env` file:

- `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`
- `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET`
- `WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`

Never place the access token in frontend code, Excel files, or GitHub. Generate
a new Meta access token if one has been exposed.
